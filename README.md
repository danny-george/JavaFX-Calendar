# JavaFX-Calendar
A simple calendar application made with JavaFX 11.0.2

Features:

Event creating, editing, removing, and displaying

Error handling on invalid event creation or editing

Month by month viewing

Current day highlighting

Ability to jump to current month

This application needs to be run through a terminal.
I am currently in the process of refining this GitHub, but it should be able to be run at the moment.

NOTE: I am still in the process of implementing certain features.
